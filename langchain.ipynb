      " Angular Documentation Angular is an application-design framework and development platform for creating efficient and sophisticated single-page apps. These Angular docs help you learn and use the Angular framework and development platform, from your first application to optimizing complex single-page applications for enterprises. Tutorials and guides include downloadable examples to help you start your projects. Assumptions These docs assume that you are already familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some of the tools from the latest standards, such as classes and modules. The code samples are written using TypeScript. Most Angular code can be written with just the latest JavaScript, using types for dependency injection, and using decorators for metadata. Feedback We want to hear from you. Report problems or submit suggestions for future docs. Contribute to Angular docs by creating pull requests on the Angular GitHub repository. See Contributing to Angular for information about submission guidelines. Our community values respectful, supportive communication. Please consult and adhere to the Code of Conduct.\n",

The @Component() decorator specifies Angular-specific information like CSS selector, HTML template and optional CSS styles. A simple example is shown in the code snippet. Additionally, Angular uses \\'Dependency Injection\\' to help you declare your dependencies without worrying about their instantiation. It means you can focus on the logic of your code as Angular will manage the object creation process for you. This significantly contributes to making your code more testable and flexible. An example of Dependency Injection in Angular is also shown below.\",\\n\"code\": \"A minimal Angular component:-\\\\n\\\\nimport { Component } from \\'@angular/core\\';\\\\n\\\\n@Component({\\\\n  selector: \\'hello-world\\',\\\\n  template: `\\\\n    <h2>Hello World</h2>\\\\n    <p>This is my first component!</p>\\\\n  `\\\\n})\\\\nexport class HelloWorldComponent {\\\\n  // The code in this class drives the component\\'s behavior.\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nDependency Injection in Angular:-\\\\n\\\\nimport { Injectable } from \\'@angular/core\\';\\\\n\\\\n@Injectable({providedIn: \\'root\\'})\\\\nexport class Logger {\\\\n  writeCount(count: number) {\\\\n    console.warn(count);\\\\n  }\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nimport { Component } from \\'@angular/core\\';\\\\nimport { Logger } from \\'./logger.service\\';\\\\n\\\\n@Component({\\\\n  selector: \\'hello-world-di\\',\\\\n  template: `\\\\n  <h2>Hello World: DI!</h2>\\\\n  <button (click)=\\\\\"onClick()\\\\\">Increase Count</button>\\\\n  <p>Button has been clicked {{count}} times.</p>\\\\n  `\\\\n})\\\\nexport class HelloWorldDIComponent {\\\\n  count = 0;\\\\n  constructor(private logger: Logger) { }\\\\n\\\\n  onClick() {\\\\n    this.count++;\\\\n    this.logger.writeCount(this.count);\\\\n  }\\\\n}\",\\n\"difficulty\": \"beginner\"\\n}',\n",

To create a form, it is recommended to use FormBuilder and FormGroup. These two classes are part of the @angular/forms package provided by Angular. FormBuilder offers methods to quickly generate form controls, while FormGroup is to group those controls.\\\\nFormBuilder service creates an instance through dependency injection. Then use formBuilder.group() to create form models that contain different content such as name, address etc. Combining form controls ensures form data remains consistent.\\\\n\\\\nTo retrieve data from the form use onSubmit() method. This methods can send form data to a desired destination or process it accordingly. For instance, to clear the form after submission we can call the reset() method.\\\\n\\\\nRemember to bind the formGroup in HTML  using formGroup property to attain functionality. Then, use the ngSubmit event binding to listen for the form submission and call the onSubmit() method with the form value.

The prerequisites comprise being familiar with JavaScript, HTML, CSS. Having Knowledge of TypeScript is beneficial, though not necessary. You also require Node.js and npm package manager installed on your local system. Angular relies on an active LTS or maintenance LTS version of Node.js and the npm package manager for many features and functions. After having the required setup, you will learn how to install Angular CLI by running the command \\'npm install -g @angular/cli\\' in your terminal. You will then create a new workspace and an initial application using the CLI by entering the command \\'ng new my-app\\'. Finally, you\\'ll learn how to serve your application locally using the command \\'cd my-app\\' and \\'ng serve --open\\'.
