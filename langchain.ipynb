      " Angular Documentation Angular is an application-design framework and development platform for creating efficient and sophisticated single-page apps. These Angular docs help you learn and use the Angular framework and development platform, from your first application to optimizing complex single-page applications for enterprises. Tutorials and guides include downloadable examples to help you start your projects. Assumptions These docs assume that you are already familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some of the tools from the latest standards, such as classes and modules. The code samples are written using TypeScript. Most Angular code can be written with just the latest JavaScript, using types for dependency injection, and using decorators for metadata. Feedback We want to hear from you. Report problems or submit suggestions for future docs. Contribute to Angular docs by creating pull requests on the Angular GitHub repository.
